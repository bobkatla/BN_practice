"""
File to double check after we got simple data
Mostly will the case of zero-cell (data exists in the census but not in sample)
--> we can aggregate or remove --> aggregate, maybe moveup 

Something todo, defo:
1. Taking only the Metro Mel (Greater Mel and Greater Geelong), they do exist all in VISTA
2. Check what SA don't exist in sample, alot sa1 yes, but maybe not sa2
3. Deal with zero cell (aggre how, maybe just combine with nearest SA)
