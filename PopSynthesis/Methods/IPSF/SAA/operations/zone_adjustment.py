Now for each zone we will do adjustment

For a given zone (a vector), we can identify which att is pos and which is neg so we can replace
Inputs:
curr_syn - curr_syn of that zone (matrix) with counts
diff_census - diff from census with neg and pos (vector)
pool - data of all possible values (matrix) with counts
adjusted_atts - adjusted atts (list) so we need to maintain those combinations

Outputs: New syn_pop for that zone

We need to think about how to better this process, not with pairing and simple finding, maybe matrix opt
