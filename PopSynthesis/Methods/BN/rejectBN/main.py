    # Integerization using weights
    # Rejection sampling loop for HH
    # Rejection sampling loop for P
    # NOTE: SAVE THE POOLS
    # Clustering the P
    # DL training with H atts to cluster for selection 
    # Loop through each zone (SA1), should be from largest to smallest or entropy balance maybe (like PopSim)
    # Loop through each HH and use the DL model for selection (start with random but maybe with constrains later)
    # When if the cluster exhaust, sample again or I use another constrain to limit the selection, or second best
